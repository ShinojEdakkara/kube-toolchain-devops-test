# MobileFirst Foundation Server Helm Chart
IBM MobileFirstâ„¢ Platform Foundation is an integrated platform that helps you extend your business to mobile devices.

IBM MobileFirst Platform Foundation includes a comprehensive development environment, mobile-optimized runtime middleware, a private enterprise application store, and an integrated management and analytics console, all supported by various security mechanisms.

For more information: [MobileFirst Server Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSNJXP/welcome.html)
## Prerequisites

1. (Mandatory) A pre-configured DB2 database is required and this information will be supplied to server helm chart to create appropriate tables for Server.

2. (Optional) You can provide your own keystore and truststore to the deployment by creating a secret with your own keystore and truststore.

Pre-create a secret with keystore.jks, keystore-password.txt, truststore.jks, truststore-password.txt and provide the secret name in the field keystores.keystoresSecretName.

Keep the files keystore.jks and its password in a file named keystore-password.txt, truststore.jks and its password in a file named truststore-password.jks.  
From the command line, execute:
*    `kubectl create secret generic mfpf-cert-secret --from-file keystore-password.txt --from-file truststore-password.txt --from-file keystore.jks --from-file truststore.jks`

Note that the names of the files should be the same as mentioned here: keystore.jks,keystore-password.txt, truststore.jks and truststore-password.txt.

Provide this secret name in keystoresSecretName to overide the default keystores.

If you plan to connect MobileFirst Server to Operational Analytics, then use the helm chart for MobileFirst Operational Analytics to create it first, before creating the Server.

## Accessing MobileFirst Server
From a browser, use *external_ip:nodeport/mfpconsole* to access  Mobile Foundation Operations Console.

Get the Server URL by running these commands:  
 1. If you need to use https port:
   ```
   export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
          -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
   export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
          -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[1].nodePort}" services {{ template "fullname" . }})
   echo https://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/mfpconsole
   ```
 2. If you need to use http port:  
   ```
   export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
          -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")  
   export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
          -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services {{ template "fullname" . }})  
   echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/mfpconsole
   ```
